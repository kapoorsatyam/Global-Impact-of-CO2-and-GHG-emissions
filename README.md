# 🌍 **Global Impact of CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project explores the **global impact of CO₂ and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions**, highlighting their environmental and societal consequences. By analyzing emissions data across sources, sectors, and regions, the study:  
- Investigates emissions trends and patterns.  
- Examines the correlation between emissions and global life expectancy.  
- Assesses the effectiveness of key international policies, such as the Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol.

## 🔍 **Methodology**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Cleaned missing values and standardized formats.  
- Established relationships between tables using a unique `Code_Year` identifier.  

### **2. Data Analysis**  
- Built SQL queries to explore trends by sector, region, and year.  
- Calculated emissions ratios (e.g., **CO₂/GHG**) for sectoral insights.  

### **3. Policy Impact Evaluation**  
- Analyzed emissions trends before and after policy enactments.  
- Focused on periods like **2010–2015** and **2015–2020** for policy comparisons.

## 🌟 **Key Findings**  

### **Regional Trends**  
- Linked emissions data to continents and countries.  
- Identified countries achieving the largest emissions reductions.  

### **Policy Effectiveness**  
- Nations adhering to the **Paris Agreement** recorded measurable reductions in per capita emissions.  
- Quantified the percentage change in emissions pre- and post-policy implementation.  

### **Sectoral Contributions**  
- Highlighted **transportation** and **energy production** as top emission sources.  
- Detailed breakdown of emissions by type (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide).  

### **Correlation Analysis**  
- Found inverse relationships between emissions levels and life expectancy in several regions.
